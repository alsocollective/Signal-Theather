===============
  There is a specific format to which the content should be formed
  		there can be no space between div id="active" and div id="archive"
  		if you change the id's/class make sure that it relates to the options in javascript
      right now the class content is what allows the objects to be built, be sure not use the same classes that being used in the js options
