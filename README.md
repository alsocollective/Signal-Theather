===============
  There is a specific format to which the content should be formed<br>
  		there can be no space between div id="active" and div id="archive"<br>
  		if you change the id's/class make sure that it relates to the options in javascript<br>
      right now the class content is what allows the objects to be built, be sure not use the same classes that being used in the js options<br>
